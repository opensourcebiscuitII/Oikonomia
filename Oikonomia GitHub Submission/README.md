## Usage Information

The actual program that you should run is Oikonomia.java. This code uses the classes found in Ingredient.java and IngredientType.java. Pantry.json contains all of the data that the user generates and is modified by user action in Oikonomia.java. Feel free to view it to see what's in your pantry! 

Note: This program makes use of the Gson library in order to save and load data to pantry.json. Gson is found in the Gson 2.13.2.jar file. If something is wrong with that .jar, Gson can be downloaded from https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.code.gson/gson.
